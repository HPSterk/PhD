# PhD
Code sandbox for project within my PhD
Started on assessing the conditions of the Flow Country peatlands in northern Scotland.
Will try to use GitHub as the to-go platform to discuss my coding (mainly python/R related issues and examples, but hopefully also some raspberry pi related stuff) and try to mingle with the online community a bit more!
